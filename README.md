# Custom Gradle Task

## Overview

## Requirements

* Java, prerably OpenJDK 13
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) 6.0.1 or newer

## Setup

Clone the Gradle Project locally. Execute `gradle tasks --all`. This will compile
the Custom Task Library and include it in your classpath.

## Usage

```bash
gradle tasks --all
grade greeting
```

### Turning into a "standalone", distributable plugin/task

To turn the code in `buildSrc/` into a standalone, distributable Gradle Plugin
or Task, move the contents of `buildSrc/` to their own `src/` or their own
project directory. Then compile it into a JAR and push it to Maven, or whatever
repository you're using. Then use Gradle to pull that dependency and run your
custom Task or Plugin.

## Development and Testing
